# 🌸 KNN Classification Using Iris Dataset

A machine learning project that applies the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify iris flower species based on sepal and petal dimensions.

---

## 📌 Abstract
The Iris dataset, introduced by Ronald Fisher, contains 150 samples with four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width  

The goal of this project was to classify the flowers into three species (**Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica**) using **KNN** in R, and visualize the results.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing** – Normalization with min-max scaling  
- **Train-Test Split** – 70% training, 30% testing  
- **KNN Classification** – Implemented with *k = 5*  
- **Performance Evaluation** – Confusion matrix, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity  
- **Visualization** – 2D (Sepal Length vs Sepal Width) and interactive 3D plots  
- **Nearest Neighbor Analysis** – Inspection of neighbors influencing predictions  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **R**
- Libraries: `class`, `caret`, `ggplot2`, `plotly`, `dplyr`, `FNN`

---

## 📊 Results
- Achieved high accuracy due to the structured nature of the dataset  
- **Setosa** species was clearly distinguishable  
- **Versicolor** and **Virginica** had overlapping regions → occasional misclassifications  
- Visualization helped interpret class separability  

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Understanding of **distance-based supervised learning (KNN)**  
- Importance of **data normalization** in ML  
- Using **visualizations** to interpret classification results  
- Exposure to **model evaluation metrics**
